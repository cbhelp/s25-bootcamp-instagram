Instagram Demo Page

During meeting 1, we made a project that is sample Instagram page using VStacks, HStacks, Text lines and Images.
My Instagram page includes a profile picture, a username, a post, like, comment, and message buttons, a caption, and more.
In the future, I would like to incorporate buttons into my project to make the page interactive.
